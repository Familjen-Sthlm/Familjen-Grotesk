Familjen Grotesk is a sans serif typeface with a contemporary appearance intended for both text and display. Large notches known as “ink traps” add style to headlines and clarity to captions. The large x-height, closed apertures and sturdy upper-case letters relate to the grotesque subgenre of sans serifs.

The Latin component was designed by Anders Wikström, Jonas Bäckman, Matilda Gysing, Kristian Möller, Örjan Nordling (Familjen STHLM AB (https://familjen.se)). 

Familjen Grotesk project is led by Kristian Möller, a type designer based in Stockholm.
